**Automatically skip YouTube ads – even when there's no "Skip" button.**  
Say goodbye to annoying ads and wasted time.

## ⚡ What It Does

`skip-skipbutton-youtube` is a lightweight browser userscript/plugin that:
- Detects when an ad starts on YouTube
- Skips it immediately – even **before** the skip button appears
- Works for both **video** and **banner** ads
- Runs silently in the background – no setup required

---

## ✅ Features

- 🚀 Skips ads instantly
- 🧠 Smart detection of unskippable ads
- 🎯 Targets all YouTube ad containers
- 💡 Minimal footprint (no bloat)
- 🌐 Works with YouTube globally

## 👨‍💻 How It Works

It uses DOM mutation observers and player state checks to:
- Monitor when ads begin playback
- Trigger a fast seek past the ad timestamp or force video reload when necessary

All done **automatically**, without you ever needing to hit "Skip."
